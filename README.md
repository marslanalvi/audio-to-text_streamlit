# Whisper Audio Transcription with Streamlit

This is a simple Streamlit app that allows users to upload an audio file and get the transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model. The app supports multiple audio formats, including `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, and `.opus`. It converts the uploaded audio file into a `.wav` format (if necessary) and then uses Whisper to transcribe the audio to text. The transcription is returned in **English** by default.

## Features
- Upload audio files in `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, or `.opus` formats.
- Whisper model transcribes the audio to English text.
- Supports automatic conversion from `opus` format to `wav` format.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
